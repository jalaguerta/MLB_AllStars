# Predicting MLB All-Stars Using Fundamental Baseball Statistics

This project, developed by Jamie Laguerta (73122848) for MANU 465, focuses on utilizing fundamental baseball statistics to predict whether Major League Baseball (MLB) players should be selected as All-Stars. The work is inspired by the remarkable performance of players like Ohtani Shohei, highlighting the blend of analytics and sports.

## Objective

The primary aim is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict MLB All-Star selections based on five key statistics: Batting Average (BA), Home Runs (HR), Runs Batted In (RBI), On-Base Percentage (OBP), and Slugging Percentage (SLG).

## Data

The dataset includes MLB player statistics from the 2023 season, featuring batting performance metrics alongside All-Star designations. For a detailed description of the statistics used, refer to the appendix at the end of this document.
